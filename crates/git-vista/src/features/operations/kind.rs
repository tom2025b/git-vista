//! The closed set of git operations the frontend can ask the server to perform.
//!
//! Moved verbatim from `state.rs`'s `PendingOp` (M1.11, #64, decision D4). The variants
//! already map 1:1 onto `api.rs` functions — `dialogs/confirm.rs` has one match arm each —
//! so this is a re-home and a rename, not a redesign.
//!
//! Framework-free by construction: the only payloads are `String`, `Option<String>` and
//! `git_vista_core::activity::Undoable`, so the operations core is host-testable.
//!
//! `Debug`/`PartialEq`/`Eq` are new (the old `PendingOp` derived only `Clone`). The core
//! needs equality to enforce ADR 0020's rule that one idempotency key may not be rebound to
//! a *different* operation, and needs `Debug` for the assertions that prove it.
